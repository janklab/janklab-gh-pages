## Does Janklab support GNU Octave?

No. Hey, I like Octave – I'm co-maintainer of [Octave.app](http://octave-app.org/) – but as of 2019, Octave is just too far behind Matlab in terms of support for new features. This includes both newer syntactic niceties, and actual functionality that Janklab uses. I'm not willing to go to the effort to write Octave-compatible code.
